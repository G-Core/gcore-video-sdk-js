## PlaybackRate class

> This API is provided as a beta preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

Allows changing the playback speed of the video.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class PlaybackRate extends UICorePlugin 
```
**Extends:** UICorePlugin

## Remarks

Depends on:

- [media\_control](./player.mediacontrol.md)

- [bottom\_gear](./player.bottomgear.md)

It renders a button in the gear menu, which opens a dropdown with the available playback rates.
